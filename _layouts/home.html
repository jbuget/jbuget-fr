    <p>Hi! It's Jérémy. I'm a <a href="https://github.com/jbuget">full-stack developer</a> since 2007.</p>
    <p>I'm french and I live close to Paris with my wife, our two children and our old english bulldog.</p>
    <p>I love making innovative Web sites for the general public, such as the <a href="https://www.clubmed.fr">booking site</a> of Club Med, the <a href="http://www.ingdirect.fr/credit-immobilier/#simulateurCI">home loan simulator</a> for ING Direct or the new <a href="https://tickets.rolandgarros.com">online ticketing service</a> of Roland-Garros.</p>
    <p>I worked 5 years for <a href="http://www.octo.com/fr">OCTO Technology</a>, as a software architect and developer. In 2016, I became the leader of the <a href="http://rejoins.octo.com/tribes#68-web-front">WEBF tribe</a>, dedicated to the Web front-end development.</p>
    <p>Since 2015, I am the CTO of <a href="https://pix.beta.gouv.fr">Pix</a>, a french public service I co-founded that helps people to measure, develop and valorize their digital competence.</p>
    <p>My main technologies are JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I used Java and JVM technologies for years but this time is far away now.</p>
    <p>After making the right thing at the right time, the thing I prefer is making the thing right. I try to make my <a href="http://ricardogeek.com/docs/clean_code.pdf">code clean</a> and I'm aware of <a href="http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321834577/samplepages/0321834577.pdf">DDD</a>, <a href="https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">clean architecture</a> and all other <a href="http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org">software craftsmanhip practices</a> or <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org">agile methodologies</a>.</p>
    <p>Today, the most important thing to me when I code is "knowing, using and respecting the standards". It's why I prefer Vue.js over React, or Ember.js over Angular.</p>
    <p>My main purpose when I wake up every morning is <em>"help people growing and having fun"</em>.</p>
